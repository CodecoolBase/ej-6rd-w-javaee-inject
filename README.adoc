= About

Sample repo to demonstrate how to use simple Depdency Injection via JavaEE annotations in a web-application deployed to WildFly.

The application implements a simple contact list search functionality.
Contact `sources' and the `contact search logic' are decoupled via interfaces.
Different implementations of these interfaces could be created and could be injected via the framework without modifying too much code making the design fairly modular.

= Quickstart

* Build the WAR file via Maven -- `mvn war:war`
* Deploy it to WildFly -- `mvn wildfly:redeploy`
** This assumes that your WildFly installation uses the username/password combination configured in the `pom.xml`.
* Then, you should be able to access `localhost:8080/javaee-inject-1.0-SNAPSHOT/rest/contacts?query=Smi` and get back a result.
